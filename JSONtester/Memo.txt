	-> Stop forgetting to compile with the jar,
           javac -cp json-simple-1.1.1.jar filename.java
	-> Don't forget to run with whole directory path or it gets stuck in jar,
	   java -cp .:json-simple-1.1.1.jar filename
	-> json_simple.jar might be missing the ParserException for some reason,
	   use json-simple-1.1.1.jar instead
